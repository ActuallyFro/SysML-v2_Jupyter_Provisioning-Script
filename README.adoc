= SysML Jupyter Installation for Ubuntu 24.04

== Understanding the Key Changes

The original SysML installation script has several limitations when running on modern Ubuntu 24.04 systems. The improvements provided in the patch file and START script address these issues to create a more consistent and reliable installation process.

=== Key Improvements in the Patched Installation Script

The `delta-of-install-sh.patch` shows critical changes that make the installation more robust:

1. **Standalone Installation**: Added Miniconda installation step (Step 0)
   * Original script assumed Conda was already installed
   * New script checks for Conda and installs it if missing
   * Ensures consistent Python environment across installations

2. **Dedicated Environment**: Creates isolated `sysml-env` conda environment
   * Original script modified the base environment
   * New approach prevents conflicts with existing Python packages
   * Makes installation more reproducible and easier to troubleshoot

3. **Removed Java Dependency**:
   * Original script required Java 11+
   * New script eliminates this dependency, simplifying installation
   * Reduces setup complexity and potential failure points

4. **Explicit Python Version**:
   * Specifies Python 3.9 instead of generic Python 3.*
   * Provides consistent behavior across installations

5. **Improved JupyterLab Configuration**:
   * Added proper code cell configuration with line numbers and code folding
   * Uses Python script embedded directly in bash for better portability
   * Ensures consistent development experience

6. **Eliminated UI Extension Requirement**:
   * Original script installed the JupyterLab SysML extension
   * New approach uses only the kernel, reducing complexity
   * Better compatibility with modern JupyterLab versions

== The START-Jupyter_SysML.sh Helper Script

The `START-Jupyter_SysML.sh` script provides essential environment validation and streamlines the Jupyter startup process on Ubuntu 24.04:

1. **Environment Validation**:
   * Checks if user is in the correct conda environment (`sysml-env`)
   * Verifies that the SysML kernel is properly installed
   * Provides helpful commands to fix environment issues if detected

2. **Network Configuration**:
   * Automatically detects available network interfaces
   * Configures Jupyter to bind to the correct network interface
   * Makes the notebook accessible from other machines on the network
   * Uses dynamic IP detection instead of hardcoded values

3. **Reference Commands**:
   * Includes commands to verify kernel installation
   * Shows how to examine kernel configuration files
   * Provides reinstallation commands if needed

== Implementation Guide for Ubuntu 24.04

To leverage these improvements on Ubuntu 24.04:

1. **Apply the patch or use final script**:
   * Either apply the patch: `patch install.sh < delta-of-install-sh.patch`
   * Or use the provided `final_jupyter_install.sh` directly
   * Make executable: `chmod +x final_jupyter_install.sh`
   * Run: `./final_jupyter_install.sh`

2. **Use the START script for validation and launching**:
   * Make executable: `chmod +x START-Jupyter_SysML.sh`
   * Run: `./START-Jupyter_SysML.sh`
   * Follow the on-screen prompts

3. **First-time fixes**:
   * If prompted to run `conda init`, do so and restart your terminal
   * If kernel is missing, the START script will show the exact command to reinstall it

== Why These Changes Matter for Ubuntu 24.04

Ubuntu 24.04 introduces several changes that can impact SysML installation:

1. Python package compatibility issues with newer system libraries
   * Isolated conda environment prevents these conflicts

2. Network interface changes in newer Ubuntu versions
   * Dynamic IP detection in START script ensures proper network binding

3. Java version differences
   * Removing Java dependency eliminates version compatibility problems

4. Default shell behavior changes
   * More robust shell handling (`#!/bin/bash` instead of `#!/bin/sh`)

By using the patched installation script and START helper script, you can achieve a more consistent and reliable SysML Jupyter environment on Ubuntu 24.04 systems, avoiding the common provisioning issues that occur with the original script.
